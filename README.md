# ComputerVisionWithCNN
Image recognition using Keras and Tensorflow by utilizing both ANN's and CNN's.

I highly recommend checking out the "ImageClassifier.ipynb" file first to see how a typical ANN works before checking out "ImageClassifierCNN.ipynb".

Once finished with learning the basics from those two notebooks, checkout the "CatsVsDogs.ipynb" file for a more complex example of how to use a CNN to differentiate between colored images of cats from colored images of dogs.
